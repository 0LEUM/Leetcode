/*Given an array of strings words (without duplicates), return all the concatenated words in the given list of words.

A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.

 
Example 1:

Input: words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
"dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
"ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".

Example 2:

Input: words = ["cat","dog","catdog"]
Output: ["catdog"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 104
1 <= words[i].length <= 30
words[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
All the strings of words are unique.
1 <= sum(words[i].length) <= 105*/
